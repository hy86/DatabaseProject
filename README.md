This Repository contains code and files that related to project for Database and SQL: A Database and Website for an Online Second-hand Book Store.

I and Chang Liu were working as a group for this project. We dicided to built an application of an online second-hand book store which supports create accounts,search a book, write reviews, look up your activity histories and give recommendations.

In this project:
1. Disigned Entity/Relation diagram according to the proposal above with according relevant real-world constraints. Then mapped our E/R diagram, including constraints,into a SQL schema using Postgresql on Microsoft Azure.
2. Inserted some data into the database and add more unique, and good-style attribute- and tuple-based CHECK constraints.
3. Using phython and flsk built a web application and used Python package SQLAlchemy to connect to the database. Runned the application on Azure Virtual Machine.
